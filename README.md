### Under Development

**Weacast is under development and currently in beta-test, updates will be pushed frequently.
As a consequence it should be considered unstable, not yet ready for production use.
Although we try to avoid this wherever possible, `0.x` versions on the master branch can promote breaking changes in the API.**

### Have a look at our [showcase](https://weacast.gitbooks.io/weacast-docs/SHOWCASE.html) first

A [live demo](http://demo.weacast.xyz) is usually running at [demo.weacast.xyz](http://demo.weacast.xyz).
